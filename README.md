# turismoviajeeuropa

This is one of my first projects in 2020.
This website was the second part presented to the tourism company. 
Institutional colors, visual appeal and ease of use were again taken into account.
I created this with Bootstrap library and the pictures of the places to visit are made in the style of Masonry Cards.
It has a sticky navbar.
